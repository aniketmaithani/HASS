<b> <h4> 2. Overall Description </h4> </b> 
This section will give an overview of the whole system. The system will be explained in its context to show how the system interacts with other systems and introduce the basic functionality of it. It will also 
describe what type of <b> stakeholder </b> that will use the system and what functionality is available for each type. At last, the constraints and assumptions for the system will be presented.

<b> <h4> 2.1 Product perspective </h4> </b> 
The system will be divided into two parts: 
<br> 1. Hardware Configuration </br> 
<br> 2. Front End - Mobile Application & Web Portal </br> 

<br> 
<b> Hardware Configuration </b> refers to the modules that will be incorporated to make the system robust and efficient. This will include monitoring system, AVR micro-controllers, Raspberry Pi [HUB] and other sensors. The hardware device will send all the relevant information for which it is customized to the centralised <b> HUB </b> which will then pass the information to specific remote IP. The remote server will then send the information as <b> Push Notifications. </b> 
<br> 
<br> 
<br> 

<b> Front End </b> part of the application will be divided into two modules : 
<br> 	
<br> 1. Web Portal - User will login to their specified IP and will be able to access the admin panel.  </br>
<br> 2. Mobile Application - User will be able to access the admin panel via his/her cellphone. </br> 
Since this application requires data logging therefore a centralised database server will be used for storing logs and other vital information. Both the 
mobile application and web portal will communicate with the database to display the data. All of the 
database communication will go over the Internet.

<b> <h4> 2.2 Product Functions </h4> </b> 
The entire HASS product will give user the following utility : 
<br>
<br> - Temperature/Humidity Control  </br> 
<br> - Live Feed of the power consumption </br> 
<br> - Live Camera Feed from the house </br> 
<br> - Security Notifications on the GO </br> 
<br> - Lightning Control </br> 
<br> 
<b> <h4> 2.3 User Characteristics </h4> </b>
<br> 
There will be two types of the user who will be interacting with the system. 
<br> 
1. Normal User - who will use the naive feature such as climate control etc. while being physically present at the location 
<br> 
2. Administrator - who will have admin priviledges to see the stats on the go and also to remotely access the equipment. 
<br> 	
<b> <h4> 2.4 Constraints </h4> </b>
The HASS system will have the following constraints : 
<br> 
- Internet Connection 
<br> 
- GPRS 
<br> 
- Number of Peripherals 
<br> 
- Voltage - any drastic change in the voltage to the hardware may cause complete burnout of the module or the system as a whole.
